The firmware is based originally on an implementation from
Bradley A. Minch, Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering (see
http://pe.ece.olin.edu/ece/projects.html and
http://pe.ece.olin.edu/ece/projects/lab2_18F2455.zip ) with modifications
from Ben Dugan and Jan Wagemakers, see
http://old.nabble.com/Re%3A-Re%3A-sdcc-and-USB-p1905786.html and
http://www.janwagemakers.be/wordpress/?p=102 .

I completely removed the structured macro code (ENGR2210.inc) and converted
the lab2.asm file to assembler coding (most of it landed in the new file
usb.asm). The configuration and the main routine are now in the new file
main.asm. In this process I may have introduced many errors that were not
present in the original code. So, if this code does not work at all, blame
me, not the authors of the original firmware.
