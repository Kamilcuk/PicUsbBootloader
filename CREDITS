1. Firmware

Files located in the device folder.

The USB firmware is based on a firmware implementation from Bradley A. Minch,
Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering (see
http://pe.ece.olin.edu/ece/projects.html and
http://pe.ece.olin.edu/ece/projects/lab2_18F2455.zip ) with modifications
from Ben Dugan and Jan Wagemakers, see
http://old.nabble.com/Re%3A-Re%3A-sdcc-and-USB-p1905786.html and
http://www.janwagemakers.be/wordpress/?p=102 .

I completely removed the structured macro code (ENGR2210.inc) and converted
the lab2.asm file to assembler coding (most of it landed in the new file
usb.asm). The configuration and the main routine are now in the new file
main.asm. In this process I may have introduced many errors that were not
present in the original code. So, if this code does not work at all, blame
me, not the authors of the original firmware.

The HID report descriptor has been written from scratch, the devices does
no longer claim to be the example keyboard from the HID specification.

2. C++ Code

Files located in the host folder.

The C++ code is based on the usblamp project from Daniel KÃ¤fer, see
https://github.com/daniel-git/usblamp . I removed everything that went
beyond the communication with the usb device and adapted it to the specifics
of my device.

3. Java Code

Files located in the java folder.

The two binary files libusb-1.0-win32.dll and libusb-1.0-win64.dll are
copied from the project http://libusbx.org/. I downloaded 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusbx/files/releases/1.0.12/Windows/libusbx-1.0.12-win.7z/download
and copied the files /MS32/dll/libusb-1.0.dll and /MS64/dll/libusb-1.0.dll.
