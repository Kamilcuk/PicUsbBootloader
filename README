h1. eXtreme Fedback Device

The aim is to bring the feedback from the continous integration build
faster to the developer.
For this a microcontroller (PIC18Fxx5x) controls some indicators (typically 
three LEDs mimicing a traffic light). The host runs a java program that
polls the CI build server and tells the microcontroller via usb which
LED(s) to light.

h2. Building

To build: Run make in the top level directory as this:
$ make VID=<vid> PID=<pid>
Where <vid> is the vendor id and pid is the product id you want to use for
your device in hexadecimal without a leading "0x".
Example: $ make VID=0A0A PID=A0A0
(I am trying to obtain my own VID:PID combination for this device,
but had no success so far. As soon as I have a valid address, the build step
will become somewhat simpler.)

Needs to compile: make, gcc++, javac, maven, gputils
Needs at runtime: java, usblib (on linux), HID.DLL (on windows).

If all goes well the main result will be a jar file under
buildmonitor/target named buildmonitor-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar. Use
it with a command line like this:

$ java -jar buildmonitor-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar http://jenkins.my.domain:8080/view/BuildViewToWatch
